  <h3 class="b-700">MINORS.</h3>
  <p>
At various places on the Web site, we may ask users to enter their age or birth date or we may allow minors to use this Web site to sign up for trainings offered by the Foundation. If you are a minor signing up for any training offered through this Web site or by the Foundation, you must only do so after obtaining permission from your parent or guardian to participate in such trainings. The Foundation relies on you as a user to be truthful in responding to these questions and assumes that you have parent or guardian permission to participate in any training offered by the Foundation. If a user does not identify his/her proper age, we will have no way of verifying actual age with respect to our Internet Privacy Policy. If you are a parent or guardian who agrees to allow your minor child, or a child for whom you act as a legal guardian, to use the Web site, you agree that you will be solely responsible for (a) the online conduct of such Minor; (b) monitoring such Minor’s access to and use of the Service; and (c) the consequences of any use of the Service by such Minor. The disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth herein shall apply to you for the acts of the Minor.

While the Foundation is pleased to hear from users and welcomes your submissions of User Content or comments regarding the Foundation’s programs and services, the Foundation does not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. The intent of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by the Foundation, its employees and its agents might seem to be similar to creative works submitted by users. Accordingly, while the Foundation values your User Content or other submissions, the Foundation must ask that you do not send original creative materials, except when specifically requested to do so, and then only if you understand that by doing so you have automatically provided the Foundation with consent to use your User Content or submissions as it so desires. REMEMBER, ANY USER CONTENT OR SUBMISSION YOU SEND TO US BY ANY MEANS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE NONCONFIDENTIAL AND NONPROPRIETARY AND WE SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO SUCH INFORMATION AND SHALL BE FREE TO REPRODUCE, USE, DISCLOSE, AND DISTRIBUTE THE INFORMATION TO OTHERS.
