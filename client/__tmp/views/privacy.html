Sharing of Personal Information
We may share personal information with our agents, researchers or service providers who act for or on behalf of the Foundation in connection with the activities of the Foundation, or for further processing in accordance with the purpose(s) for which the data was originally collected. We require our agents, researchers and service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of personal information they maintain on behalf of the Foundation and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which they received the information.

This aggregate data will not contain any information that personally identifies you. </p>

In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes; for example, to detect unauthorized activity on the Web site. In such cases, server log data, containing IP addresses, would be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.

      <h3 class="b-700">A Note to Parents/Guardians—Additional Information About Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>
A Note to Parents/Guardians—Additional Information About Children’s Privacy
At the Foundation, children’s privacy is important to us. Therefore, we take additional measures to help children protect their privacy while online, including not asking them to disclose more personally identifiable information than is necessary for them to participate in an activity.
</p>
      <p>
Children can participate in many of our features without providing personally identifiable information. However, to enable their participation in certain of our interactive features or to sign up for training sponsored by the Foundation, we may ask children to provide us with personally identifiable information. The types of information we may request include name as well as child’s and parent’s email addresses and/or their driver’s license number to verify they are eligible for the trainings sponsored by the Foundation. We use a child’s email address to respond to a specific request to participate in an activity.</p>
      <p>We also may collect additional information such as computer information, gender, state and postal code. We may ask additional questions regarding preferences on various topics through surveys. 
</p>
      <p>
We do not share children’s personally identifiable information with outside third parties not bound by this Privacy Policy. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to help us conduct a contest or sweepstakes, send prizes to winners, host trainings funded by the Foundation, or provide customer service related to activities offered by the Foundation. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing.
