        At the Arbella Insurance Foundation, we believe that educators in the classroom have a very important role to play in educating teen drivers on the risks of distracted driving. We have created a suite of content for download that range from a classroom presentation you can present to your students, to a fact sheet about research on the dangers of distracted driving, to a number of classroom exercises that can be used in a number of different subjects.</p>
<p>
We invite you to incorporate any or all of these materials into your school curriculum as we continue to partner with you to ensure teens become safer, more focused drivers. And we welcome your feedback on these materials. Please send feedback to Brenna Morrissey, Distractology Coordinator, at <a href="mailto:brenna.morrissey@arbella.com">brenna.morrissey@arbella.com.</a></p>
